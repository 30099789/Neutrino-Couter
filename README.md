# Neutrino-Counter
//Functional Requirements
//The program must create an array of integers containing exactly 24 elements to represent the hours of the day.
//The array must be populated with random integers ranging from 10 to 90.
//Implement a Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the integer array.
//Implement a Binary Search algorithm to search for a specified integer in the sorted array.
//Provide a single text box for the user to input the search integer.
//Display message error if the search text box is empty when the search initializes or unsuccessful 
//The program must allow users to edit the values in the array.

//Non-Functional Requirements
//The interface should be user-friendly, allowing users to easily input search values and view results.
//The program should consistently provide correct search results and handle errors gracefully without crashing.
//Code should be modular and well-documented to facilitate future updates or modifications.
//While initially designed for 24 elements, the program structure should allow for easy adjustment of the array size if needed in the future.
//The method for generating random integers must be reliable and consistent to simulate the data stream.
//The sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort) should efficiently handle the small size of the array (24 elements).
